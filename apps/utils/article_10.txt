The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the technical feasibility and economic viability of AI systems, addressing concerns about AI's impact on the workforce. Artificial intelligence has already started replacing human jobs and several companies have started opting for AI-powered systems to get their job done. However, a recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) shows a reassuring aspect that AI might not be ready to take over certain jobs due to economic constraints . Implementing AI for some types of jobs can be expensive MIT’s latest study has revealed that there’s a cost attached to automating tasks, especially for roles that are related to images and videos and require computer vision implementation which churns out data from images and videos. The study suggests that implementing this can cost a lot of money to companies at least for now. The MIT study noted that around 23% of worker compensation related to AI computer vision tasks would be cost-effective for firms to automate. This also brings hesitancy in AI adoption in certain roles as it will come with an upfront cost associated with implementing and operating AI-assisted visual recognition technology. The study contributes a fresh perspective by identifying tasks exposed to AI automation and assessing the economic feasibility of adopting the technology. In contrast to previous research, which often highlighted the tasks and roles most susceptible to AI automation without delving into economic implications, this MIT study takes a more comprehensive approach. "'Machines will steal our jobs' is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models," the MIT researchers said. The MIT study positions itself as a pioneering effort in this direction by directly evaluating the technical feasibility and economic viability of AI systems, offering a pragmatic perspective on the ongoing dialogue about AI's impact on the workforce.

MIT study reveals economic constraints of job automation, especially for roles requiring computer vision implementation. Implementing AI for certain jobs can be expensive, deterring AI adoption. The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the technical feasibility and economic viability of AI systems, addressing concerns about AI's impact on the workforce. Artificial intelligence has already started replacing human jobs and several companies have started opting for AI-powered systems to get their job done. However, a recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) shows a reassuring aspect that AI might not be ready to take over certain jobs due to economic constraints . Implementing AI for some types of jobs can be expensive MIT’s latest study has revealed that there’s a cost attached to automating tasks, especially for roles that are related to images and videos and require computer vision implementation which churns out data from images and videos. The study suggests that implementing this can cost a lot of money to companies at least for now. The MIT study noted that around 23% of worker compensation related to AI computer vision tasks would be cost-effective for firms to automate. This also brings hesitancy in AI adoption in certain roles as it will come with an upfront cost associated with implementing and operating AI-assisted visual recognition technology. The study contributes a fresh perspective by identifying tasks exposed to AI automation and assessing the economic feasibility of adopting the technology. In contrast to previous research, which often highlighted the tasks and roles most susceptible to AI automation without delving into economic implications, this MIT study takes a more comprehensive approach. "'Machines will steal our jobs' is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models," the MIT researchers said. The MIT study positions itself as a pioneering effort in this direction by directly evaluating the technical feasibility and economic viability of AI systems, offering a pragmatic perspective on the ongoing dialogue about AI's impact on the workforce.
