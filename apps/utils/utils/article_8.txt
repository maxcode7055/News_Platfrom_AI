Tech Artificial intelligence: The future Lavina Shiwani @ ThoughtsUnboxed Aug 10, 2021,  14:48  IST In today’s day and age of growing technology, we are getting in touch with different technology day by day. In which one of the technologies of computer science is Artificial intelligence (AI), which is the most fascinating and universally accepted field of computer science which has a significant scope in the future. AI can be inclined to have a machine to work as a human. In simple words, Artificial intelligence is when machines think, learn and make decisions similar to humans. Importance of AI: Elimination of “Human error”: Chances of errors are reduced, as humans make mistakes from time to time, however, computers cannot make mistakes if programmed accurately. Analysis more and deeper data: With the usage of AI-guided systems for data analysis, we can automatically analyze, clean, and visualize data. Data analyzed with AI can be relevant, exact and concrete. Adds up intelligence: Artificial intelligence adds intelligence to the existing products. It performs high-volume and computerized tasks instead of automating manually eliminating the risk of errors. Far-fetched accuracy: Using deep neural networks, AI achieves accuracy.  AI computers have the ability to harness massive amounts of data and use their learned intelligence to make optimal decisions and discoveries in fractions of the time that it would take humans. Equilibrium and scalability: AI finds structure and regularities in data so that algorithms can acquire skills, and this automation cuts costs and brings new levels of consistency, speed and scalability to business processes. Artificial Intelligence is changing the world: Artificial intelligence is able to exercise a noteworthy amount of data in a short amount of time — more data than any human or computer program has ever been able to process. Artificial intelligence in healthcare- The future of AI in healthcare is a step towards standardising healthcare for the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals, while at the same time making it less costly and more accurate through AI-powered care. This intelligence will definitely be a game-changer in confer better medical care to patients. We can expect a totally different future for healthcare as robots interact with patients, check on their health condition, and evaluate the further need for an appointment with a doctor. Artificial intelligence in transportation and manufacturing sectors- In the coming years we might observe the evolution of smart and self-governing vehicles. As of now, self-driving cars are already available however, by the next two to three decades the world will witness more people using it. While in the manufacturing sector, elevated use of robots in factories and analytics sector will add to the quality of products and standardize the logistics and supply chain. Hence, it has been established that artificial intelligence is the computer knowledge that has human traits, nevertheless, these computers and robots help the environment to grow, and they respond intelligently to help human beings.
