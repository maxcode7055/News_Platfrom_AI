Tech AI: Is It Making Our World Better or Worse? JOSEPH @ AILife Nov 16, 2022,  23:15  IST How AI is changing our world is a question that has been on everyone’s mind since technology started becoming more prevalent in our lives. While there are many benefits to using AI, there are also some concerns about how it might impact our world in the future. Over the years, the term artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in a variety of contexts. It mainly refers to a computer’s capacity to carry out operations that would normally require human intellect, such as comprehending language and identifying things. Thanks to developments in machine learning, AI has advanced significantly in recent years. AI that uses machine learning helps computers to learn from data without explicit programming. As a result, cutting-edge AI applications like machine translation, facial recognition, and self-driving automobiles have been created. Our world is already witnessing a huge impact from AI. However, it’s crucial to keep in mind that AI is still in the early stages of development and that there are several ethical questions regarding its application. For example, as autonomous vehicles are becoming more common, there are concerns about who should be held responsible in the event of an accident. There are also concerns regarding how automation of certain work may affect employment in the future. AI is changing our world in many ways by using it in several industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. AI is being used in healthcare to hasten the drug discovery process and increase diagnosis precision. AI is being utilized in finance to identify fraudulent activity, forecast market trends, and streamline financial procedures. In addition to changing the way we live and work, AI is also having an impact on our society. For example, automated systems are starting to play a role in decision-making processes such as hiring and lending. This could lead to biases against certain groups of people if the data used to train the algorithms is not representative of the population. As AI becomes more prevalent in our society, it is important to be aware of these potential pitfalls and should work to avoid them. What then is the truth? Is AI making our world a better place or not? The answer to this question is quite complex.  Some researchers think that AI will ultimately enhance human lives in a variety of ways. For instance, technology might assist us in finding a cure for illnesses, ending poverty, and easing traffic. AI can also make our cities smarter and more efficient in the future. Others raise concerns that AI might have adverse effects on society. For instance, when machines progressively automate jobs that human workers have typically performed, it could lead to significant job losses. It could also lead to an increase in social inequalities by giving rich people access to the latest forms of technology while leaving the poor behind. Ultimately, it’s up to us whether AI should make the world a better place, as AI will be shaped based on our choices. AI has already begun to change our world in both good and bad ways. The potential for AI to create a better world is huge. If we can harness its power for good, AI could help us solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. But if we’re not careful, AI could also make these problems worse. It’s up to us to decide which future we want to create.
